# Learning How to Clean Data in Python - Analyzing Car Classifieds on EBay

The objective of this project is to provide an example of how to clean data with Python.

We utilized a used-cars dataset found in a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The original dataset was scraped fom eBay Kleinanzeigan and is available on kaggle. For this analysis, we used a sample of the original dataset with 50,000 that was prepared by Dataquest with a less-cleaned version of the data.

In this repository you find two files:

- analyzing_car_classifieds_ebay.ipynb with a notebook with the complete analysis
- autos.csv with the datafile
